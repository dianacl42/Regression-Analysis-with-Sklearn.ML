# 📊 Regression Analysis with Sklearn

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (**Regression1.ipynb**) that demonstrates regression techniques using **Scikit-Learn**. The notebook covers data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for predictive analysis.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset used in this notebook is [specify dataset if known]. It is preprocessed to handle missing values, scale features, and split into training and testing sets.

## 🚀 Models Implemented
The following regression models are included:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Polynomial Regression** (if applicable)
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **Random Forest Regressor**

## ⚙️ Installation & Requirements
To run this notebook, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Regression1.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Evaluation
The notebook evaluates regression performance using:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared Score (R²)**

## 🔍 Results & Observations
- [Summarize key findings, e.g., "Random Forest performed best with the lowest MSE."]
- [Mention any insights, e.g., "Feature scaling improved model performance."]

## 🤖 Future Improvements
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning.
- Try additional regression models like **SVR** or **XGBoost**.
- Perform feature selection for better predictions.
